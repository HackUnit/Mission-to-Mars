# Mission-to-Mars

## The Web App's Beginnings
This project began as a web app that scraped various sites for data on the planet Mars. The originator of the idea: Robin, wanted to use this web app as a portfolio project to assist in being hired at NASA.

## Finalizing the Web App
Since the foundation had been set, Robin wanted to add some extra final touches to really push it over the edge. To finish the web app, a scraping-friendly site was found that had Mars’s hemispheres. The web app was formatted to include all four of the hemisphere images. Utilizing BeautifulSoup and Splinter, the full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images were stored on a Mongo database. The web application then displayed the scraped data. Furthermore, to really add some polish, the design of the web app was formatted to accommodate these images and further refinements were added.
